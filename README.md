This repository provides a differentiable wave optics simulator for **point spread function (PSF) generation**, **image formation**, and **end-to-end optimization** of computational imaging systems.  
It is designed for research in computational imaging, holography, and optics-aware machine learning.

---

## Features

- **Differentiable Wave Optics Simulation**  
  Forward model with gradient support for optimization.

- **PSF Generation**  
  Simulate diffraction-limited or aberrated point spread functions.

- **Image Formation**  
  Render images under custom optical systems.

- **End-to-End Optimization**  
  Jointly optimize optical parameters and downstream tasks.

- **Config-Driven Pipeline**  
  All experiments are configured via JSON files for reproducibility.

All experiments are controlled via JSON configs:
```bash
python main.py --config configs/experiments/show_psfs.json
```

- **Generate PSFs**
```bash
python main.py --config configs/show_psfs.json
```

- **Render Images**
```bash
python main.py --config configs/display_triplet.json
```

- **End-to-End Optimization**
```bash
python main.py --config configs/train_cellphonelens.json
```
